          Welcome!
          In the following you have the possibility to answer a quiz that deals with our notion of authenticity in times of virulent automatic machine learning. 
          In recent years, advancements in technology have made it increasingly difficult for individuals to distinguish reality from fiction. 
          The advent of deepfakes, bots, and artificial intelligence (AI) have allowed for the manipulation of images, videos, and audio recordings making it 
          challenging to determine the authenticity of media.
         </p>
         <p class="text-introduction">
          Additionally, the use of bots on social media platforms can spread false information at a rapid pace, creating confusion and mistrust among users. 
          AI algorithms can also be used to personalize news feeds and search results, potentially creating echo chambers where individuals are only exposed to information that 
          confirms their existing beliefs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-introduction">
          To combat these challenges, it is important for individuals to be critical when consuming media
          and to fact-check information from multiple sources. In order to train our critical approach towards machine-generated content you can play the following Quiz-Game.

            Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence 
          processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific 
            applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. <br>
            As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling 
            to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer
            to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. 
            AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for 
            writing and training machine learning algorithms. [...] <br>

            <h3 id="ai-text-right">What is Artificial intelligence?</h3>  
            Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines and systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. There are several different approaches to creating AI, but the most common methods include: <br>
            1. Machine Learning: This approach involves training a computer to recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on that data. There are different types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. [...] <br></button>
